# Ginkgo Editor

## A (heavily) WIP text editor entirely in Rust

![Logo Image](/images/ginkgoLogo.png)

Ginkgo is how I learned Rust!

It is a spin-off of my previous C++ text editor, [JED](https://github.com/jasbury1/jed), which itself was a spin-off of the popular miniature text editor [Kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)

## Features

Ginkgo supports many of Kilo's features, such as CTRL commands for saving and quitting.
It also contains many Vim commands! Ginkgo has both normal and insert modes, supports hjkl key movements, and more.
Finally, it also supports cursor movement and selections for ease-of-use.

## The Ginkgo tree

Ginkgo trees are beautiful. But anyone who has ever been around one knows that they have a very "distinct" smell.
Equivalently, this text editor aims to be beautiful and simplistic. 
But since I am using this project as an outlet for learning rust, like the Ginkgo tree some of Ginkgo's code may smell a little off...
It will continue to be a work of progress as it undergoes future revisions! And it remains open to suggestions and collaboration.
